Summary(Optional) :   This minor project is based upon Video Games Rating by 'ESRB'. It includes what is distribution of ESRB ratings in the dataset and there are a lot of games with rating T, but not so many games with rating M and ET. Also, we can see that about half of all games are with rating T (~690), games with E and ET ratings are about 410 â€“ 400 and games for matures are only about 390. For calculating frequency the code reads a CSV file containing video game data, extracts specific content feature columns, calculates the frequency of each content feature in the dataset, and displays the frequency values. Maximum frequency of blood 432 and  minimum is mature_humor 22,  Columns like Blood, Blood and Gore, Strong Language have strong positive correlation with ESRB rating.But nudity, use of drugs and alcohol have really low correlation, there are more than 1400 computer games with blood scenes in this dataframe. For model we have 3 models First model is simple Decision Tree Classifier. It is having not bad accuracy score: 0.82. How we can see Decision Tree Classifier is really good at this dataset. SECOND MODEL IS  RandomForestClassifier vesion 1 model we can see that Random Forest Classifier is better than Decision Tree here, because it is having 0.85 of accuracy score.

Classification/Regression
First model: linear regression 1
Second model:RandomForestClassifier
